## 🎯 What You'll Learn Today

You'll learn how to make your home WiFi network safe from bad people who want to steal your information.

## 🤔 What is WiFi and Why Protect It?

**WiFi is like a bridge:**
- It connects your devices to the internet
- Your phone, computer, and tablet all use it
- If it's not protected, strangers can use it
- They might steal your personal information

**Think of it like your front door:**
- You wouldn't leave your front door wide open
- You lock it to keep strangers out
- WiFi needs a "lock" too

## 🔐 The 5 Simple Steps to Safe WiFi

### Step 1: Change the Default Password
**What this means:**
- Your router comes with a simple password like "password123"
- Everyone knows these default passwords
- You need to change it to something only you know

**How to do it:**
1. Look at the sticker on your router
2. Write down the web address (like 192.168.1.1)
3. Type that address in your web browser
4. Log in with the default username and password
5. Look for "WiFi Password" or "Network Password"
6. Change it to something strong (follow our password rules!)

### Step 2: Give Your Network a New Name
**What this means:**
- Your WiFi probably has a name like "NETGEAR_123"
- This tells bad people what type of router you have
- Change it to something fun but not personal

**Good names:**
- FlowersAndCoffee
- BookLoversHouse
- Pizza4Everyone

**Bad names:**
- JohnSmith123 (your real name)
- 123MainStreet (your address)
- Default names that came with the router

### Step 3: Turn On WPA3 (or WPA2) Security
**What this means:**
- This is like putting a strong lock on your WiFi
- It scrambles your information so bad people can't read it
- It's usually in your router settings under "Security"

**Look for these options:**
- ✅ WPA3 (newest and best)
- ✅ WPA2 (older but still good)
- ❌ WEP (old and dangerous)
- ❌ Open/No security (very dangerous)

### Step 4: Update Your Router Regularly
**What this means:**
- Router companies fix security problems
- You need to install these fixes
- It's like updating your phone apps

**How to do it:**
1. Check your router's web page monthly
2. Look for "Firmware Update" or "Router Update"
3. Click "Check for Updates"
4. Install any updates it finds
5. Some routers update automatically (even better!)

### Step 5: Create a Guest Network
**What this means:**
- This is a separate WiFi for visitors
- They can use internet but can't see your devices
- Keeps your main network private

**How it helps:**
- Friends can connect without knowing your main password
- If their device has problems, it won't affect yours
- You can turn it off when no one is visiting

## 🔍 How to Check If Your WiFi is Safe

### Monthly Safety Check:
1. **Look at connected devices**
   - Count how many devices should be connected
   - Remove any you don't recognize

2. **Check your internet speed**
   - If it's suddenly slow, someone might be using it
   - Run a speed test at speedtest.net

3. **Review your settings**
   - Make sure security is still turned on
   - Check that your password hasn't changed

### Warning Signs Someone is Using Your WiFi:
- ❌ Internet is much slower than usual
- ❌ You see devices you don't recognize
- ❌ Your data usage is higher than normal
- ❌ Strange pop-ups or ads on your devices

## 🛡️ Extra Protection Tips

### For Advanced Users:
- **Turn off WPS** (WiFi Protected Setup) - it's not secure
- **Use MAC address filtering** for important devices
- **Change the admin password** for your router settings
- **Turn off remote management** unless you need it

### For Everyone:
- **Place your router in the center of your home**
- **Keep router firmware updated**
- **Use strong, unique passwords**
- **Restart your router monthly**

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family WiFi Safety

### Teaching Kids:
- Only connect to your home WiFi
- Never share the WiFi password with friends
- Tell an adult if something seems wrong
- Don't connect to random public WiFi

### For Grandparents:
- Write down your WiFi name and password
- Ask family to help set up the router
- Don't worry if it seems complicated - ask for help!
- Focus on using strong passwords

### For Parents:
- Set up parental controls on your router
- Monitor what devices are connected
- Teach kids about public WiFi dangers
- Create separate networks for smart home devices

## 🆘 What to Do If Something Goes Wrong

### If Your WiFi Gets Hacked:
1. **Don't panic** - this can be fixed
2. **Unplug your router** for 30 seconds
3. **Change all passwords** immediately
4. **Check all your devices** for problems
5. **Call your internet company** if you need help

### If You Forget Your Password:
1. **Look for the reset button** on your router
2. **Hold it down for 10 seconds** while plugged in
3. **Use the default password** (on the sticker)
4. **Set up your security again**

## 🎉 You're Now a WiFi Safety Expert!

Great job! You now know how to:
- ✅ Change your WiFi password
- ✅ Pick a good network name
- ✅ Turn on security features
- ✅ Keep your router updated
- ✅ Create a guest network
