## 🎯 What You'll Learn Today

You'll learn how to spot fake emails that try to trick you, so you can stay safe online.

## 🤔 What Are Email Tricks (Phishing)?

**Phishing is like a digital con artist:**
- Bad people send fake emails
- They pretend to be banks, stores, or friends
- They want to steal your passwords or money
- They're very good at making emails look real

**Think of it like this:**
- A stranger calls saying they're from your bank
- They ask for your account number
- You wouldn't give it to them, right?
- Email tricks work the same way

## 🚨 Warning Signs of Fake Emails

### 🔍 Look for These Red Flags:

#### 1. Scary or Urgent Messages
**Examples:**
- "Your account will be closed in 24 hours!"
- "Urgent: Suspicious activity detected!"
- "Act now or lose your money!"

**Why they do this:**
- They want you to panic
- When you're scared, you don't think clearly
- You might click without checking if it's real

#### 2. Generic Greetings
**Bad signs:**
- "Dear Customer" (not your name)
- "Dear Sir/Madam"
- "Hello User"

**Good signs:**
- Uses your real name
- Mentions specific account details
- Feels personal and familiar

#### 3. Asking for Personal Information
**Never give these via email:**
- Social Security numbers
- Passwords
- Bank account numbers
- Credit card information
- Driver's license numbers

**Remember:** Real companies already have your information - they won't ask for it in emails!

#### 4. Suspicious Email Addresses
**Bad examples:**
- amazon-security@fake-email.com
- bank0fsecurity@gmail.com
- paypal.verification@random-site.net

**Good examples:**
- noreply@amazon.com
- security@bankofamerica.com
- service@paypal.com

#### 5. Strange Links and Attachments
**Warning signs:**
- Links that don't match the company name
- Unexpected attachments
- "Click here now!" buttons
- Links that look like: bit.ly/xyz123

## 🛡️ How to Check if an Email is Real

### Step 1: Take a Deep Breath
- Don't click anything immediately
- Fake emails want you to rush
- Real companies can wait for you to verify

### Step 2: Check the Sender
- Look at the email address carefully
- Does it match the company name?
- Are there spelling mistakes?
- Does it look official?

### Step 3: Look for Mistakes
**Fake emails often have:**
- Spelling errors ("You're account")
- Grammar mistakes ("We has detected")
- Weird punctuation
- Random capital letters

### Step 4: Hover Over Links (Don't Click!)
- Put your mouse over any links
- Look at the web address that appears
- Does it match the company?
- If it looks weird, don't click!

### Step 5: Contact the Company Directly
- Call the company's official phone number
- Go to their website by typing the address yourself
- Ask: "Did you send me an email about...?"
- They'll tell you if it's real or fake

## 🎯 Common Email Tricks to Watch For

### 1. Fake Bank Emails
**What they say:**
- "Suspicious activity on your account"
- "Verify your identity immediately"
- "Your account has been locked"

**What to do:**
- Don't click any links
- Call your bank directly
- Log into your account the normal way

### 2. Fake Package Delivery
**What they say:**
- "Your package couldn't be delivered"
- "Pay extra shipping fees"
- "Update your address"

**What to do:**
- Check tracking on the official website
- Call the shipping company
- Don't download attachments

### 3. Fake Prize Notifications
**What they say:**
- "You've won $1,000!"
- "Claim your prize now!"
- "You're our lucky winner!"

**What to do:**
- Remember: you can't win contests you didn't enter
- Real prizes don't ask for money upfront
- Delete these emails immediately

### 4. Fake Social Media Alerts
**What they say:**
- "Someone tagged you in a photo"
- "You have a new message"
- "Your account will be deleted"

**What to do:**
- Log into social media normally
- Check your notifications there
- Don't click email links

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Email Safety

### Teaching Kids:
- Never open emails from strangers
- Always ask an adult before clicking links
- Don't give out personal information
- If something seems too good to be true, it probably is

### For Grandparents:
- When in doubt, ask a family member
- It's okay to delete emails you're not sure about
- Real companies will contact you other ways too
- Don't be embarrassed to ask for help

### For Parents:

- Teach kids about email safety
